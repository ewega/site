Hi, I'm Eldrick Wega - Thanks for dropping by 👋🏾

I'm Cameroonian 🇨🇲 and Malian 🇲🇱 and currently work as a Senior Global Black Belt - DevTools at Microsoft, based out of Nairobi, Kenya 🇰🇪. 

I'm passionate about a couple of things: building products with people, development of the African continent, economic systems, and jumping rope!

<small>The image above is the African Renaissance Monument in Senegal. Known as the "Monument de la Renaissance Africaine", it is meant to represent the unified drive for betterment of the continent.</small>
